# 🌍 Air Quality Prediction: Linear Regression vs KNN Regressor

This project focuses on predicting **Air Quality Index (AQI)** pollutants using **Machine Learning models**.  
It compares **Linear Regression** and **KNN Regressor** in predicting pollutant concentrations like CO, NO₂, and NMHC.

---

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Predictive modeling using:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **KNN Regressor**
- Model evaluation with metrics:
  - **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**
  - **R² Score**
- Visualization of actual vs predicted values  
- Clear comparison of both models  

---

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **pandas, numpy** (data preprocessing)
- **scikit-learn** (machine learning models & metrics)
- **matplotlib, seaborn** (visualizations)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TanmayAgarwal40/Air-Quality-Prediction-LinearRegression-Vs-KNN-Regressor-.git
   cd Air-Quality-Prediction-LinearRegression-Vs-KNN-Regressor-

pip install -r requirements.txt

jupyter notebook notebooks/AQI_Prediction.ipynb


📈 Results
Linear Regression performed well on continuous pollutant prediction but was sensitive to outliers.
KNN Regressor handled non-linear patterns better but required tuning (K-values).
Sample Visualization:
(Add plots like Actual vs Predicted here for better visibility)

🔮 Future Improvements
Try other regression models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
Incorporate time-series forecasting for AQI trends
Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask

# Air Quality Index (AQI) Predictor

This project predicts Air Quality Index (AQI) pollutants (CO, NO₂, NMHC, etc.) using machine learning models such as **Linear Regression** and **KNN Regression**.  
The goal is to provide early insights into pollution levels using sensor and weather data, enabling better awareness, research, and decision-making.

---

## Features
- Multi-pollutant prediction (CO, NO₂, NMHC, etc.)  
- Implements Linear Regression and KNN Regression models  
- Performance evaluation with RMSE and R² Score  
- Side-by-side comparison of Linear vs KNN performance  
- Data preprocessing for missing or invalid values  
- Insights into how weather and sensors affect pollutant concentration

---

## Tech Stack
**Language:** Python

**Libraries:**
- `pandas`, `numpy` (data handling)  
- `scikit-learn` (machine learning models)  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (visualization)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AQI-Predictor.git
cd AQI-Predictor

pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook AQI.ipynb

Results and Comparison
Linear Regression: Fits a global line to model pollutant trends
KNN Regression: Uses neighborhood patterns for prediction
The comparison chart highlights RMSE and R² for each pollutant across both models.

Applications
Government: Early warning systems and policy-making
Education: Teaching data science and ML with real-world datasets
Public: Understanding pollution patterns and awareness

✅ This file already has:
- **Gray code blocks** (via fenced ```bash``` / ```python``` / ```markdown```)  
- **Graph placeholders** (`results/rmse_comparison.png`, `results/CO_actual_vs_pred.png`) — they will show up once you push the generated images into `results/` folder.  

Do you also want me to **generate the `requirements.txt` content** for you automatically from your notebook, so you don’t miss any library?
